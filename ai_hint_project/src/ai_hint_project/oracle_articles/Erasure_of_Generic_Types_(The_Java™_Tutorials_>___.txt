The Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8. Examples and practices described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced in later releases and might use technology no longer available.
See
Dev.java
for updated tutorials taking advantage of the latest releases.
See
Java Language Changes
for a summary of updated language features in Java SE 9 and subsequent releases.
See
JDK Release Notes
for information about new features, enhancements, and removed or deprecated options for all JDK releases.
Erasure of Generic Types
During the type erasure process, the Java compiler erases all type parameters and replaces each with its first bound if the type parameter is bounded, or
Object
if the type parameter is unbounded.
Consider the following generic class that represents a node in a singly linked list:
public class Node<T> {

    private T data;
    private Node<T> next;

    public Node(T data, Node<T> next) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }

    public T getData() { return data; }
    // ...
}
Because the type parameter
T
is unbounded, the Java compiler replaces it with
Object
:
public class Node {

    private Object data;
    private Node next;

    public Node(Object data, Node next) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }

    public Object getData() { return data; }
    // ...
}
In the following example, the generic
Node
class uses a bounded type parameter:
public class Node<T extends Comparable<T>> {

    private T data;
    private Node<T> next;

    public Node(T data, Node<T> next) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }

    public T getData() { return data; }
    // ...
}
The Java compiler replaces the bounded type parameter
T
with the first bound class,
Comparable
:
public class Node {

    private Comparable data;
    private Node next;

    public Node(Comparable data, Node next) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }

    public Comparable getData() { return data; }
    // ...
}
