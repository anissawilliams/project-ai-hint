The Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8. Examples and practices described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced in later releases and might use technology no longer available.
See
Dev.java
for updated tutorials taking advantage of the latest releases.
See
Java Language Changes
for a summary of updated language features in Java SE 9 and subsequent releases.
See
JDK Release Notes
for information about new features, enhancements, and removed or deprecated options for all JDK releases.
Generic Methods and Bounded Type Parameters
Bounded type parameters are key to the implementation of generic algorithms. Consider the following method that counts the number of elements in an array
T[]
that are greater than a specified element
elem
.
public static <T> int countGreaterThan(T[] anArray, T elem) {
    int count = 0;
    for (T e : anArray)
        if (e > elem)  // compiler error
            ++count;
    return count;
}
The implementation of the method is straightforward, but it does not compile because the greater than operator (
>
) applies only to primitive types such as
short
,
int
,
double
,
long
,
float
,
byte
, and
char
. You cannot use the
>
operator to compare objects. To fix the problem, use a type parameter bounded by the
Comparable<T>
interface:
public interface Comparable<T> {
    public int compareTo(T o);
}
The resulting code will be:
public static <T extends Comparable<T>> int countGreaterThan(T[] anArray, T elem) {
    int count = 0;
    for (T e : anArray)
        if (e.compareTo(elem) > 0)
            ++count;
    return count;
}
