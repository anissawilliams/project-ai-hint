The Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8. Examples and practices described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced in later releases and might use technology no longer available.
See
Dev.java
for updated tutorials taking advantage of the latest releases.
See
Java Language Changes
for a summary of updated language features in Java SE 9 and subsequent releases.
See
JDK Release Notes
for information about new features, enhancements, and removed or deprecated options for all JDK releases.
Lesson: Classes and Objects
With the knowledge you now have of the basics of the Java programming language, you can learn to write your own classes. In this 
lesson, 
you will find information about defining your own classes, including declaring member variables, methods, and constructors.
You will learn to use your classes to create objects, and how to use the objects you create.
This 
lesson 
 also covers nesting classes within other classes, and enumerations
Classes
This section shows you the anatomy of a class, and how
to declare fields, methods, and constructors.
Objects
This section covers creating and using objects. You will learn how to instantiate an object, and, 
once instantiated, how to use the
dot
operator to access the object's instance variables and methods.
More on Classes
This section covers more aspects of classes that depend on using object references and the
dot
operator 
that you learned about in the preceding section: 
returning values from methods, the
this
keyword, class vs. instance members, and access control.
Nested Classes
Static nested classes, inner classes, anonymous inner
classes, local classes, and lambda expressions are covered.
There is also a discussion on when to use which approach.
Enum Types
This section covers enumerations, specialized classes that allow you to define and use sets of constants.
