Lesson: Interfaces and Inheritance
Interfaces
You saw an example of implementing an interface in the previous 
lesson. 
You can read more about interfaces here—what they are for, why you might want to write one, and how to write one.
Inheritance
This section describes the way in which you can derive one class from another. That is, how a
subclass
can inherit fields and methods from a
superclass
. You will learn that all classes are derived from the
Object
class, and how to modify the methods that a subclass inherits from superclasses. This section also covers interface-like
abstract classes
.
