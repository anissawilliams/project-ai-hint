The Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8. Examples and practices described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced in later releases and might use technology no longer available.
See
Dev.java
for updated tutorials taking advantage of the latest releases.
See
Java Language Changes
for a summary of updated language features in Java SE 9 and subsequent releases.
See
JDK Release Notes
for information about new features, enhancements, and removed or deprecated options for all JDK releases.
Type Erasure
Generics were introduced to the Java language to provide tighter type checks at compile time and to support generic programming. To implement generics, the Java compiler applies type erasure to:
Replace all type parameters in generic types with their bounds or
Object
if the type parameters are unbounded. The produced bytecode, therefore, contains only ordinary classes, interfaces, and methods.
Insert type casts if necessary to preserve type safety.
Generate bridge methods to preserve polymorphism in extended generic types.
Type erasure ensures that no new classes are created for parameterized types; consequently, generics incur no runtime overhead.
