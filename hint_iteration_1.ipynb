      "Java inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class.\n",

      "\n",
      "* A parent class (also called the superclass or base class) has its own characteristics, methods, and behaviors.\n",
      "* A child class (also called the subclass or derived class) inherits everything from the parent class and can also add new things or override some of the existing ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a simple example:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Parent Class: Animal**\n",
      "```java\n",
      "public class Animal {\n",
      "    public void sound() {\n",
      "        System.out.println(\"The animal makes a generic sound\");\n",

      "    public void sound() {\n",
      "        System.out.println(\"The dog barks\");\n",

      "```\n",
      "In this example:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The `Animal` class is the parent, and it has a method called `sound()` that prints a generic message.\n",
      "* The `Dog` class is the child, which inherits everything from `Animal`. It also overrides the `sound()` method to print a specific message for dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you create an instance of `Dog`, it will have access to all the methods and properties inherited from `Animal`, including the overridden `sound()` method. For example:\n",
      "```java\n",
      "Dog myDog = new Dog();\n",
      "myDog.sound(); // Output: \"The dog barks\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "Key points about Java inheritance:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A child class inherits everything from its parent class, including fields (variables) and methods.\n",
      "2. A child class can override methods inherited from the parent class to provide a specific implementation for itself.\n",
      "3. A child class can also add new methods or fields that are not present in the parent class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inheritance helps you create a hierarchy of classes, where each child class builds upon the characteristics and behavior of its parent class. This promotes code reuse, reduces duplication, and makes your code more organized and maintainable!\n"
